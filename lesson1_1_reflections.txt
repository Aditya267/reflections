How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
It helped in pin poiting to the exact line where the change was intoduced.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
We can see from where we started, what was our thought process at that moment of time.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
Cons: There's always can be a human error, like forgettinng to save changes
Pros: We can decide when to commit, a module or logical piece of code.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Git: Treates all files as a part of single project
While Others: treates all files as a separate project itself

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
git log: shows the complete list of commits
git diff: shows the difference between two commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
Because we can always checkout the stable version

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
That's depends on the futher part of course :P
